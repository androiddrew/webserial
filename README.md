# Web Serial Console

Serial console access in the browser! This project uses an [experimental Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) available, as of 08/06/2024, on Chrome 89+, Edge 89+, or Opera 75+.

This is a work in progress and a learning experiment. Feel free to file an issue if you encounter one.

## Local Development:
